    "text": "I’m excited for MicroPs because I get to see my code affect hardware in the real world. Writing something, probing a pin, and watching the scope confirm it did what I intended is the kind of feedback loop that makes the work satisfying and helps me absorb information.\nThis semester I want to build fluency in the basics that make systems reliable: read reference manuals without getting stuck, set up clocks cleanly, bring up GPIO/timers/serial, and write small drivers with clear init and ISR paths. I want to use interrupts and DMA with intent, understand when HAL or an RTOS helps (and when it doesn’t), and get better at debugging with a logic analyzer and scope instead of guessing.\nBy the end, I’m excited to be able to partake in a focused project I care about that uses the information I learned from the class. Looking forward to it :D"

    "text": "Hi! I’m Santiago Burgos-Fallon, a senior Engineering student at Harvey Mudd College. I love everything computers, from digital design and embedded systems to data analysis. This summer I worked at TSMC in Lithography Process Engineering, where I analyzed overlay relationships, tuned control systems, and pushed on design-for-manufacturability to improve chip yield and performance. Ive built practical digital systems including a 16 bit IEEE-754 FMA and a drone navigation project that fuses computer vision with ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning. Ive also done work relating healthcare tooling and AI for making healthcare more accesible. Currently, I am co-authoring a paper using Python-heavy data processing and visualization techniques to correlate air quality and Segregation in West Oakland. I like projects where I can go end-to-end: define the problem, model the data, write the code, and deliver something impactful."
