Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.\n\n\n\nWhat the LLM produced (Gemini)\nGood ideas it used: - Parameterized divider (CLK_FREQ, BLINK_FREQ) with $clog2 sizing - Modern SV constructs (logic, always_ff) - Clear split: top module that wraps an oscillator primitive + a blinker child\nTop-level snippet returned (abridged): module led_blink_top (output logic o_led); logic clk_48mhz; SB_HFOSC u_hfosc ( .CLKHFPU(1’b1), .CLKHFEN(1’b1), .CLKHF(clk_48mhz) ); defparam u_hfosc.CLKHF_DIV = “0b00”; // 48 MHz led_blinker u_led_blinker (.clk(clk_48mhz), .led(o_led)); endmodule\n\n\nSynthesis outcome\nRadiant failed at the oscillator instantiation with: VERI-1063: instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC Root cause: Radiant’s iCE40 UltraPlus technology library expects the HSOSC primitive, not SB_HFOSC (the SB_* form is common in iCEcube2 examples).\nFix applied (works in Radiant): // iCE40UP internal HF oscillator HSOSC #(.CLKHF_DIV(2’b00)) // 00 = 48 MHz hf_osc (.CLKHFPU(1’b1), .CLKHFEN(1’b1), .CLKHF(clk));\nI also replaced the LLM’s initial-based register inits with a tiny synchronous power-on reset (POR) counter so hardware powers up in a known state.\n\n\nQuality rating (and why)\n\nRating: B\n\nStrengths: idiomatic SV, readable, correct divide-by-N math, parameterized for reuse\n\nWeak spots: vendor primitive mismatch (SB_HFOSC vs HSOSC), defparam string style (\"0b00\"), reliance on initial for synthesis reset\n\n\n\nWhat I learned / new constructs\n\n$clog2 is handy for auto-sizing counters and synthesizes cleanly on UP5K.\nParameterizing the blink frequency made switching between 2 Hz (prompt) and 2.4 Hz (lab) a one-line change.\n\n\n\nErrors & warnings encountered\n\nRadiant: VERI-1063 instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC → resolved by switching to HSOSC #(.CLKHF_DIV(2'b00)) and wiring CLKHFPU/CLKHFEN/CLKHF.\n\n\n\nTips for using LLMs for HDL (next-time playbook)\n\nSpecify tool, family, and exact primitive in the prompt: target Lattice Radiant for iCE40 UltraPlus (UP5K) and instantiate HSOSC (ports CLKHFPU, CLKHFEN, CLKHF; param CLKHF_DIV).\nAsk for a synthesizable reset: avoid initial; include a synchronous reset or a small POR counter.\nRequest a sim-friendly testbench: faster divider + self-check to validate logic quickly.\nAsk for Radiant-specific guidance: prefer Device Constraint Editor notes over generic .lpf.\nIterate with exact error text: paste Radiant/Questa messages back to the LLM for precise fixes.\n\n\n\nAppendix: Figure index\n\nBlock diagram: hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/sv.jpg\n\nSchematic & current calc: hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/elec.jpg\n\nTop-level waves: hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/lab test waves.png, hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/lab vectors.png\n\nLED unit waves: hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/led test waves.png, hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/led text tests.png\n\nSeven-seg waves: hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/seven seg waves.png, hmc-e155-portfolio/labs/Lab1/images/seven seg tests.png"

    "text": "AI Implementation\n\nPrompt used\n\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA with internal high-speed oscillator (~20 MHz).\nWrite synthesizable SystemVerilog to scan a 4×4 matrix keypad and display the last two hex keys pressed on a dual 7-segment display. Implement: • A clock divider that derives a scan clock on the order of 100–200 Hz from the internal oscillator. • A keypad scanning controller that iterates one active-low column at a time and samples active-low rows, registering at most one key per press (debounce-by-design), ignoring additional presses while any key is held, and allowing a new registration only after release. • A top level that updates two hex digits (older and most recent) when a new key is registered and drives a time-multiplexed two-digit 7-segment display without visible flicker and with balanced brightness. Use idiomatic SystemVerilog (e.g., logic, always_ff, enumerated states for FSMs). Provide clean module boundaries and keep all state synchronous. Include brief comments explaining the design choices. Create a new Radiant project, type the code generated by the LLM in and analyze the results. If the synthesis fails, type the error message back into the LLM to see what suggestions it generates.\n\n\n\nWhat the LLM produced\n\nGood ideas it used\n\nClear module split: KeypadScan (scanner + debounce FSM), DMux (digit scan/mux), SevenSeg (combinational hex→segments), top (capture two digits, wire-up).\nSynchronous FSM with three states (IDLE → DEB → HELD), a one-shot key_valid pulse on accept, and two-flip-flop synchronizers on the asynchronous column inputs.\nRound-robin row drive and frozen row during debounce, which prevents ghosting and enforces “first press wins.”\nTime-multiplexed display with fixed duty for uniform brightness, and active-LOW segment patterns for a common-anode display.\nIncluded a scan tick to pace debounce (stable-N policy), keeping all counters/sequencing in always_ff and decoding in always_comb.\n\nGaps I had to fix\n\nRow/column polarity & direction: the prompt assumed active-low columns and sampled rows, but our board drives rows (active-LOW) and reads columns (with pull-ups). I corrected the interface and comments to match hardware.\nKey mapping: the default (row,col)→hex map didn’t match the physical keypad legend; I rewrote map_hex to our layout.\nMultiple drivers risk: key_valid was assigned in more than one procedural context in one draft. I consolidated to a single always_ff.\nDebounce edge case: the counter was clocked every system cycle; I tied it to the scan strobe so stability is measured per row sample.\nSimulation speed: initial dividers made sims painfully long; I added small counts under a guarded sim mode while leaving hardware rates intact.\n\n\n\n\nQuality rating (and why)\n\nRating: A-\nWhy: The LLM delivered a solid modular architecture and a correct synchronous FSM with proper input synchronization and single-event registration. Most fixes were integration details (board polarity, key legend, divider sizing) rather than structural rewrites.\n\n\n\nDid it synthesize first time?\n\nAlmost. It compiled after minor edits:\n\nAlign row/column direction and polarity with our board.\nFix a single-writer rule on key_valid.\nAdjust the (row,col)→hex lookup to the actual keypad legend.\nTweak divider constants (fast for sim, slow for hardware) and confirm no latches/tri-states.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’d do differently next time with an LLM\n\nState the physical contract explicitly in the prompt: “Rows = outputs, active-LOW; Columns = inputs with pull-ups (idle=1111); Segments active-LOW; digit enables En1/En2 select left/right.”\nProvide the keypad legend and pin swap up front and ask the model to generate map_hex from a small (row,col)→label table.\nAsk for +ifdef SIM dividers from the start to keep waveforms short and readable.\nRequire one-process-per-reg and “no $clog2/parameters” if a strict style is desired, so the draft matches house style without edits."
