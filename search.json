    "text": "Hi! Iâ€™m Santiago Burgos-Fallon, a senior Engineering student at Harvey Mudd College. I love everything computers, from digital design and embedded systems to data analysis. This summer I worked at TSMC in Lithography Process Engineering, where I analyzed overlay relationships, tuned control systems, and pushed on design-for-manufacturability to improve chip yield and performance. Ive built practical digital systems including a 16 bit IEEE-754 FMA and a drone navigation project that fuses computer vision with ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning. Ive also done work relating healthcare tooling and AI for making healthcare more accesible. Currently, I am co-authoring a paper using Python-heavy data processing and visualization techniques to correlate air quality and Segregation in West Oakland. I like projects where I can go end-to-end: define the problem, model the data, write the code, and deliver something impactful."
