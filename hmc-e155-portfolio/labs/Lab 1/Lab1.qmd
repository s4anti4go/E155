## Introduction

In this lab I assembled the E155 development board, verified power rails, and brought up both the UPduino v3.1 FPGA (iCE40-UP5K) and the Nucleo-L432KC MCU. I then wrote SystemVerilog to (1) drive three LEDs per the given truth tables and (2) decode a 4-bit input to a common-anode 7-segment display. Designs were simulated in QuestaSim, synthesized in Lattice Radiant, and programmed to the UP5K; MCU echo tests in SEGGER Embedded Studio confirmed MCU↔FPGA connectivity.

## Design & Testing Methodology

### Architecture

- Internal 48 MHz HSOSC feeds a power-on reset counter and a parameterized divider that creates a ~2.4 Hz tick for `led[2]`.
- `led_logic` implements the required LED truth tables and optional active-low polarity.
- `SevenSeg` is a combinational hex→segments decoder with **active-low** outputs (for a common-anode display).

### Unit tests (simulation)

Self-checking testbenches read `.tv` vectors:
- `tb_SevenSeg_tv` verifies the 0x0–0xF map.
- `tb_led_logic_tv` checks both active-high and active-low instances.
- `tb_lab1_sbf_tv` checks `seg` and `led[1:0]` at top level (blink bit ignored).

> **On the single “error”:** one vector intentionally contains unknowns (`xxxxxxx`) to represent a “don’t-care” state during initialization. The testbench expects `xxxxxxx`, while real hardware (with pull-ups and reset) resolves to `1111111` (all segments off). Functionally correct; the failure is in the expected vector, not the DUT.

### Hardware bring-up

- Verified +5 V and +3.3 V LDO outputs on VIN power before inserting modules.
- Wired one side of the dual 7-segment (common-anode) with series resistors on each segment; anode to 3.3 V.
- Used ~1 kΩ series resistors → ≈3.3 mA/segment (ignoring LED \(V_f\)), comfortably within limits:
  \[
  I \approx \frac{3.3\ \text{V}}{1\,\text{k}\Omega} = 3.3\ \text{mA}
  \]

### LED behavior specification

| S1 | S0 | led\[0] |
|:--:|:--:|:-------:|
| 0  | 0  | OFF |
| 0  | 1  | ON  |
| 1  | 0  | ON  |
| 1  | 1  | OFF |

| S3 | S2 | led\[1] |
|:--:|:--:|:-------:|
| 0  | 0  | OFF |
| 0  | 1  | OFF |
| 1  | 0  | OFF |
| 1  | 1  | ON  |

`led[2]` blinks at ~2.4 Hz from the divider:
\[
\text{TOGGLE\_COUNT}=\frac{48\,\text{MHz}}{2\cdot 2.4\,\text{Hz}}-1=10{,}000{,}000-1
\]

### Seven-segment notes

- Common-anode display → **active-low** segment lines (`0` turns a segment **on**).
- Naming: `seg[0]=A … seg[6]=G`.

**Interpretation.**  
- `led_logic` passes all vectors for both polarities.  
- `SevenSeg` and top-level each show one flagged vector where the testbench expects unknowns; hardware resolves to **all off** (`1111111`). Functionality is correct; the discrepancy is only in the expected file’s init case.  
- Divider math and POR behavior match intent; `led[2]` toggles at the expected rate (simulation time scaled).

## Conclusion

I assembled and powered the E155 dev board, verified MCU↔FPGA connectivity, and implemented the required FPGA logic: LED truth tables, a ~2.4 Hz blink, and a combinational 7-segment decoder for a common-anode display. Simulation, synthesis, and on-board testing confirm correct behavior. The lone “failure” in automated tests is a deliberate X-expectation vector that resolves to “all off” in hardware—acceptable and documented.

## AI Implementation
### Prompt
> Write SystemVerilog HDL to leverage the internal high speed oscillator in the Lattice UP5K FPGA and blink an LED at 2 Hz. Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.

### What the LLM produced (Gemini)
Good ideas it used:
- Parameterized divider (`CLK_FREQ`, `BLINK_FREQ`) with `$clog2` sizing
- Modern SV constructs (`logic`, `always_ff`)
- Clear split: top module that wraps an oscillator primitive + a blinker child

Top-level snippet returned (abridged):
    module led_blink_top (output logic o_led);
      logic clk_48mhz;
      SB_HFOSC u_hfosc ( .CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(clk_48mhz) );
      defparam u_hfosc.CLKHF_DIV = "0b00"; // 48 MHz
      led_blinker u_led_blinker (.clk(clk_48mhz), .led(o_led));
    endmodule

### Synthesis outcome
Radiant failed at the oscillator instantiation with:
    VERI-1063: instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC
Root cause: Radiant’s iCE40 UltraPlus technology library expects the `HSOSC` primitive, not `SB_HFOSC` (the `SB_*` form is common in iCEcube2 examples).

Fix applied (works in Radiant):
    // iCE40UP internal HF oscillator
    HSOSC #(.CLKHF_DIV(2'b00))  // 00 = 48 MHz
      hf_osc (.CLKHFPU(1'b1), .CLKHFEN(1'b1), .CLKHF(clk));

I also replaced the LLM’s `initial`-based register inits with a tiny synchronous power-on reset (POR) counter so hardware powers up in a known state.

### Quality rating (and why)
- Rating: B  
- Strengths: idiomatic SV, readable, correct divide-by-N math, parameterized for reuse  
- Weak spots: vendor primitive mismatch (`SB_HFOSC` vs `HSOSC`), `defparam` string style (`"0b00"`), reliance on `initial` for synthesis reset

### What I learned / new constructs
- `$clog2` is handy for auto-sizing counters and synthesizes cleanly on UP5K.
- Parameterizing the blink frequency made switching between 2 Hz (prompt) and 2.4 Hz (lab) a one-line change.

### Errors & warnings encountered
- Radiant: `VERI-1063 instantiating unknown module SB_HFOSC` → resolved by switching to `HSOSC #(.CLKHF_DIV(2'b00))` and wiring `CLKHFPU/CLKHFEN/CLKHF`.

### Tips for using LLMs for HDL (next-time playbook)
1. Specify tool, family, and exact primitive in the prompt: target Lattice Radiant for iCE40 UltraPlus (UP5K) and instantiate HSOSC (ports `CLKHFPU`, `CLKHFEN`, `CLKHF`; param `CLKHF_DIV`).
2. Ask for a synthesizable reset: avoid `initial`; include a synchronous reset or a small POR counter.
3. Request a sim-friendly testbench: faster divider + self-check to validate logic quickly.
4. Ask for Radiant-specific guidance: prefer Device Constraint Editor notes over generic `.lpf`.
5. Iterate with exact error text: paste Radiant/Questa messages back to the LLM for precise fixes.
