I’m excited for MicroPs because I get to see my code affect hardware in the real world. Writing something, probing a pin, and watching the scope confirm it did what I intended is the kind of feedback loop that makes the work satisfying and helps me absorb information.

This semester I want to build fluency in the basics that make systems reliable: read reference manuals without getting stuck, set up clocks cleanly, bring up GPIO/timers/serial, and write small drivers with clear init and ISR paths. I want to use interrupts and DMA with intent, understand when HAL or an RTOS helps (and when it doesn’t), and get better at debugging with a logic analyzer and scope instead of guessing.

By the end, I'm excited to be able to partake in a focused project I care about that uses the information I learned from the class. Looking forward to it :D
